<p>My name is Collin Bauer. I am a software developer with a B.S. in Computer Science from College of Charleston.</p>

<p>I have just graduated and am currently in-between jobs, but in my spare time I write <a href="/blog?filter=portfolio">blog posts</a> which focus on personal projects and research findings. Lately I have been researching <a href="/portfolio/2021/04/19/The-Halo-Game-Engine.html">the Halo game engine</a> by Bungie and 343 Industries, and have created <a href="/portfolio/2021/07/17/Map-Preview.html">my own custom map</a> for a community mapping contest. I plan to expand to later titles in the series as official tools are released, and will likely look into game development on either Unity or Unreal Engine in the future.</p>

<p>As of writing, I have recently moved to the West LA area and am seeking employment in either game design, testing, or software development. For inquiries, email me at<a href="mailto:collinlbauer@gmail.com">collinlbauer@gmail.com</a></p>
