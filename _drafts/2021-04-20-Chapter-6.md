For this post we had to read Chapter 6 of *Client-Centered Sofware Development: The CO-FOSS Approach*, by Allen B. Tucker.

This chapter focuses on "Database Development" and the concepts of relational databases. The book admits right away that this chapter does not cover databases in great detail, and refers readers to do more research on the topic, including taking a formal class on the subject. Luckily I have already done this.

### Database Principles

I couldn't really word it any better than the book does.

> "A *database* is a collection of data organized in a particular way for efficient storage and retrieval of information. Databases can be simple, as in a collection of flat files, or more complex, as in a relational database, a distributed database, or a hierarchical database."
