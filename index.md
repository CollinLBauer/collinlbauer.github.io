My name is Collin Bauer. I am a recent graduate of College of Charleston with a B.S. in Computer Science. If you would like to learn more about me, I suggest you read the [about](/about) page.

This site serves as both a blog and portfolio of sorts. This page is currently under construction, so check back later. In the meantime, check out my series on Halo modding on my [blog](/blog)!
