I wrote this in our ACM club's Discord server today.

> Hi all! This isn't really an announcement, so much as a parting abuse of @everyone , but I wanted to say a few things. I hope Cole doesn't mind. 😉
> 
> First of all, to everyone on the Discord server, thank you. Thank you for making these past couple of semesters much more bearable, and a lot more fun. It has been tough not seeing any of you in person, but the game nights and other events we had here really brightened up what has otherwise been a very stressful time. And I'm really happy that people actually used the class channels! This server might not be a true replacement for what we lost in-person, but I'm glad we found something that could fill the role here. While I hope that this server will continue to be of use in the future, I sincerely hope that your next semester is a return to form, with in-person classes, study sessions, and the real Innovation Center.

> Finally, to my fellow graduating Seniors, it is an honor to walk by your side this afternoon. Some of you already walked yesterday, but I do wish it could have been as one. Regardless, I wish you all the best of luck on your future endeavors. You will be missed.

> Thank you for making the best of the worst with us. And thank you for all the good times at College of Charleston.

> Graduation!!! Wooo!!!!! 🎓

Call me a sap, but I will genuinely miss my classmates and the CS department, even as we go on to bigger and better things. But at least I'll get to creep on everyone from our Discord server! xD Perks of being a founder, I suppose.

Blog posts will continue in a week or so. For now, 🎊🎉🥂🍾🎊!!!
