Our team progress has been fairly steady. We had a few hiccups on the way, working on getting our drivers running and automating the process, but we will probably have more than enough ready for the deliverable. We have five drivers ready and have a mockup of all our test cases. We just need to correct them so they run properly.

On the automation side, one particularly annoying element came from the implementation of our test cases. We had to make several changes to our test case format so we could parse it correctly, and have had several issues with Ubuntu and the difference betwen LF and CRLF line endings. Now that we've identified the issue, however, it's just a matter of correcting this error and running our test cases again.

None of us really like writing, so the wiki and deliverable still need work. We usually do a good job of throwing these things together, but when it comes down to the final presentation, we will definitely need to delegate our workflow better.
