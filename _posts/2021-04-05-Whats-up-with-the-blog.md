Things have been pretty quiet here. I talk a lot about doing things, but rarely ever get around to actually doing that. I am trying to change that right now, starting with the blog.

First, in regards to blog posts, I have obviously fallen behind. Over the next week I am going to rush to finish as many posts as I can, even if they don't count for much, simply because I want to have them done. At this point I am doing it for my own conscience's sake and nothing more.

Second, last week I actually implemented a simple javascript filter in my [blog](/blog/) page. This is something I have meant to do for a while, as it means I can meaningfully separate nonsense posts (like this one) from homework assignment posts, and even categorize posts related to future hobby projects and the likes.

Speaking of projects, what's up with that, too? Well, I have tried to dive into a number of things over the past couple of years, but nothing really stuck. It wasn't until recently that I realized it was because it needed to be something I could happily invest myself in. Specifically, I have recently picked up 3D modelling in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and using it to mod content into the Halo game engine. I have made great progress on this front and will me trying to write about a post a week on the subject, probably starting April 12th.

Now if I could just figure out what to do with this blog's ugly color scheme...
