### 24.6
#### Explain why program inspections are an effective technique for discovering errors in a program. What types of errors are unlikely to be discovered through inspections?

Program inspections are designed to be thorough look at one persons code by another, unrelated person. The inspector is often separate from the project team, meaning they will often find erros in the code that the programmers likely did not see. They also typically follow a checklist tailored to their environment, which will guide their inspection to catch any common or of high risk.

However, these inspections don't account for every edge case, and some errors can only be found through runtime execution. Such errors include types of memory leaks, incorrect outputs, end-of-file parse errors, and sections of code never reaching executions.
