Well, it's hurricane season again in Charleston. Hurricane Dorian hit this week. Evacuations started Monday, and anyone who didn't leave likely lost power today, or worse. I am safe, however, and hopefully everyone else else is as well.

The downside to these hurricanes is all of the time lost. Many assignments get delayed and productiveness lost to preparations, travel, or even plain goofing off thanks to new found free time. A lot of students will be busy catching up, and the professors trying to fit all of their lessons in what time is left. Admittedly I need to work on the quality of my posts as well. I love reading, but reading comprehension was never my strong suit.

So much for fall break, huh? I better get started
