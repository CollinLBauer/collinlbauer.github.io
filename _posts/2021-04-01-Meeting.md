## Upgrading your Social Media Presence

with Valerie Warnock

For my meeting selection, I joined the Charleston Women in Tech meeting on March 3rd, along with my teammates. The general theme of the meeting was how to be professional on social media.

During the meeting, Valerie spoke about different bad habits that people have developed through social media. For example, perhaps someone calls in sick one day at work, then on their personal social media that same day, post a picture of themselves at the beach instead. While this might not break any explicit rules, it reflects very poorly on that individual's work ethics, and might lead to repercussions at work, including possible termination, and difficulty finding another job.

What many people fail to realize is that employers *do* look at the social media account of their employees and of individuals they hire. With this in mind, Valerie offered a number of useful tips to help separate their work life and personal life online:

1. **Use an alias on your personal accounts**

   - When people know an individual's name, and they use that name online, it takes mere seconds to find that person's personal blogs.
   - To avoid this, separate your personal and professional accounts by only using your real name professionally, and 

2. **Avoid association with groups who make hateful posts**

   - Employers also look at who you are connected with online, and know who you are friends with and what posts they make.
   - Avoid connecting with people and groups who make public-facing posts and statements that contradict your employer's ideals, especially if they are illegal.

3. **Make posts and references about your personal projects**
  
   - When employers *do* look at your social media account, make sure they have something worth looking at, i.e. something that impresses them
   - Posting about your personal projects, coding done at home, etc., is a great way to grab the attention of employers, especially when job hunting.

I personally prefer not to use social media much, so these tips perhaps are not as applicable to me, but they are definitely good rules of thumb to follow. Perhaps the most applicable to me is to make posts about your personal projects. Until recently, I have not had much to talk about, but this will change very soon. *I will be turning this blog into a hub for my personal projects, and plan to post about them on accounts that I do use.*
