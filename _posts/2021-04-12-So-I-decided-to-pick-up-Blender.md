For a long time now, I have wanted to start a new project - something I can enjoy and be proud of once finished. I have tried a number of things before, including web apps, plugins for some games, contributions to open source projects - but outside of school work, nothing ever really stuck, until today. Over this next Summer, I will be researching and putting effort into learning how to model, texture, animate, and script for one of my favorite game franchises. At the end, I hope to have created and published some very fun experiences for others to enjoy.

The purpose of this blog series is to document my experiences learning and using various technologies, and to reflect on some decisions made and the impact these decisions had. I plan to work on this project throughout the Summer and make posts at least twice a month.

I have always had a keen interest in game design. As a teenager, I was constantly looking into creating custom levels for games which had editors, like Warcraft 3, but elements of my life inhibited this, and my life goals had shifted during high school. (It turns out growing up on an isolated peninsula limits one's access to computers and technology.) But things are different now, and studying Computer Science has renewed my interests. I have a much better understanding of how technology works, and much more freedom to apply this knowledge in places of personal interest.

So I decided to pick up Blender.

## Blender

For those who don't know, *Blender* is an open source 3D modelling, rigging, animating, and rendering software created by *The Blender Foundation*. It is free to use for anyone and can be downloaded [here](https://www.blender.org/).

Blender as a software dates back all the way to 1994 by Tod Roosendaal. It originally an in-house tool for now defunct Dutch company NeoGeo, but after being publicly released, has since been adopted as a free alternative to other software such as Cinema 4D, 3DS Max, and Maya. Licenses for Blender's contemporaries are considerably expensive, which makes Blender a very attractive option. It has also matured a lot since its earlier days, with the current version, 2.92, having many of the same or similar features as the paid options.

The uses of 3D software can be divided into several different categories:

- **Hard surface modelling** describes is about designing inorganic, often rigid objects, like man-made structures and objects.
- **Organic surface modelling** focuses on creating less rigid objects, often literally organic, living things.
- **Texturing** is the process of creating and applying, well, textures, to modelled objects. This can be as simple as painting colors on it, or applying detailed images, and may include a multitude of additional properties like how transparent or reflective the surface is.
  - **UV mapping** is the process of dictating where each face of a 3D object "maps" to an assigned texture.
- **Animating** is taking a model and applying instructions that will animate the object, as the name implies.
  - **Rigging** is a part of the animating process where bones and joints can be assigned to a model, allowing more structured animations.
- **Rendering** is where a scene is created for a given set of objects, and 

Obviously, there are a lot of parts to the whole process, and the above list only scratches the surface. Often times larger studios will dedicate an entire department to a single one of these roles! I definitely have my work cut out for me.


### What I am using it for

Blender, like any 3D modelling software, is incredibly versatile. It can be used for animated film, architecture and design, 3D printing, and, of course, video games. I intend to learn as much as I can about the many tools Blender has in its kit, but since I am starting basically from square one (and without formal teaching), I will try to take it step-by-step.

The easiest entry point into modelling is *hard modelling*, described above. This is convenient because the majority of what I intend to model will be simple, hard models. My first target will be the Halo game engine. Halo was initially released in 2001 for the Xbox. Despite being so old, it has an incredibly active modding community, and plenty of tools and documentation. Most of the environments in this title were low-poly "hard" models. I plan to practice modelling in Blender by creating environments of this same style and detail. Over time I plan to move towards higher detail models with things like weapons and bipeds, research animating, etc., and eventually target more modern game engines with higher fidelity assets.

But let's take things one step at a time.

<br/>

I am currently in the tail-end of my last semester of college, so my priorities will be there for the next month or so. For now, I do have a couple of posts lined up detailing my experience learning the Halo game engine, and will post them when I have time.
