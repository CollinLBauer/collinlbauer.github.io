### Responses

All of the assigned articles for this response discuss to software safety practices and various failures that happen when said practices are not properly followed. One discusses failures of aerospace technologies, notably the Challenger explosion. Several of them talk struggles the FBI has gone through trying to keep is systems up-to-date (or their failure to do so). Smale in particular touches on how crucial software is to businesses and some common failures these businesses often experience with software. I appreciate how these examples highlight the importance of proper software practices and would like to touch on how safety is often forgone thanks to lapses in judgment.

In Levenson's *The Role of Software in Spacecraft Accident*, he talks about how the Air Force often only implements safety systems after a major accident. Furthermore, these systems seem to turn "silent" over time over budget costs and time restraints. This suggests either safety systems become ignored over time, or project oversight becomes complacent with current safety and ignores important updates for their processes. Levenson strongly suggests rolling these safety systems into central engineering practices will ensure that these safety systems will be properly considered, and not just implemented as an afterthought.

Unfortunately, even afterthoughts are often eschewed by one of the largest government organizations out there - the FBI. In the past few decades the Federal Bureau of Investigation has struggled to create and adopt a modern system to properly and safely store, maintain and internally share the vast amount of case files. There have been a number of attempts to update their paper system to an online, data-based system. The first of which was the VCF - or Virtual Case File - was initiated in 1999 as a <!-- not done -->

In the wake of such a colossal blunder, the FBI decided to start fresh. In then-FBI director Robert Mueller announced <!-- not done -->

Sentinel <!-- something should go here -->

What I find particularly baffling about the FBI's Sentinel project is how, despite the millions of taxpayer dollars that went into its development, its inception took years to take off the ground and much of its development costs bore fruitless results. As I understand it, after the death of the VCF, Sentinel was started almost completely from scratch, with little - if any - carry-over from its predecessor. That this is due to a failure to adapt a proper development structure is largely insulting and makes the FBI look incompetent at best. I guess I understand why Goldstein describes it as the largest software failure in history.

Closing thoughts <!-- Something should go here -->

*i just posted what I had so it's on here. I'll try to finish it up tonight.*
