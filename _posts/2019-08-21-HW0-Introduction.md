  Hello! My name is Collin Bauer.  I am a senior Computer Science major at
the College of Charleston and a tutor at the Center for Student Learning.
I am originally from the town of Harwich, MA, which is at the heart of the
bustling summer destination that is Cape Cod.  Harwich is unique because
its population is twice as large during tourist season, but very quiet in
the winter.  When it got quiet, I spent much of my free time playing video
games and learning how they were made, which is how I became interested in
Computer Science.

  This blog has been created for CSCI 362 at the College of Charleston.
After the class is over, I will very likely pivot the blog for personal
use.  Heck, I already have some projects in the works on GitHub! This blog
is a work in progress, and the quality of it should improve as I begin to
understand the underlying technologies.
