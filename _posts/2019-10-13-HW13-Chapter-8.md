## Exercises

### 8.7
#### Q. *Write a scenario that could be used to help design tests for the wilderness weather station system.*

The wilderness weather station collects weather data and transmits it to an external archive. Supposing this weather station has multiple nodes to collect data from, it should have varying data depending on temperature, altitude, moisture, etc. of these nodes. This difference of data can be simulated in a development environment by placing them in pockets of space that emulate outside weather effects in controlled space.

### 8.10
#### Q. *A common approach to system testing is to test the system until the testing budget is exhausted and then deliver the system to customers. Discuss the ethics of this approach for systems that are delivered to external customers.*

Some developers may be temped to test their program as thoroughly as possible before delivering it to their customers. While this boosts confidence that their system will work the first time they demo it, the developer likely has not tested certain cases that the external customers may run into during normal operation. To counter this, it is beneficial for the developers to create iterative releases or prototypes that they may send to the external customer for them to test. The customer may then notify the developers of any such problems, thus leading to more effective use of the testing budget.
