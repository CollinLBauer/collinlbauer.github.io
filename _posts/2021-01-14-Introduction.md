Well, here we go again.

My name is Collin Bauer. I am a senior at College of Charleston, majoring in Computer Science. I am writing this blog post as part of the start of our capstone course, CSCI 462, Software Engineering Practicum.

The more astute readers have probably noticed that this is the *second* introduction post I have written. The previous one was for CSCI 362, which is a very similar course and a prerequisite for this capstone. And yes, I was a senior by credits at that time too. The CS major has a relatively heavy credit-hour workload, and I started my career at the College with some transfer credits that proved less than useful. Let's just say that my first attempt at college was a rocky one.

Outside of my studies, I am also a teaching assistant for our Programming 1 classes, taught in Python, a tutor for general CS courses, and an active officer of our college's Association for Computer Machinery chapter. As an ACM officer I have takoen many responsibilities, including organized events, hosted workshops, and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, helped organize a relaxed channel of communication for CS department students on our "Innovation Center" Discord server. As of writing, this server has roughly 130 members, most of which are current students.

Some friends and I have already discussed forming a team for this class. We wanted to use the team name `:(){ :|: & };:`, but decided "Fork Bomb" might be easier to pronounce. My fellow team members are Isabel Lally, Chloe Harris, and Ashley Woods.

I realize this blog is in a bit of a rough shape. Over the next few weeks I will clean out some of the clutter and reorganize it.
