### 8. Explaining the Code

Chapter 8 largely talks about how to properly document a project, especially in the context of FOSS. Documentation of course includes proper code comments, but extends far beyond that. Projects are often far reaching enough to warrant a wiki, with pages dedicated to different topics such as the team roster, project roadmap,  major features, issues being worked on, and how to contribute, to name a few.

Our team *does* have a publicly available repository with a project wiki, which may be found [here](https://github.com/CSCI-462-01-2021/Fork-Bomb/wiki). In it, we talk about our findings in researching the project, contributions made for it, and current progress on ongoing issues. As of writing, we have submimtted two pull requests to Habitica Android and are working on an additional two more.

### 9. Release Early, Release Often

This chapter is less a *chapter*, per se, but more of a reference to future addendums, and is frankly [pretty meta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CollinLBauer/collinlbauer.github.io/master/images/meta.gif).

From what I can tell, the point of this chapter is that open source software is constantly evolving, and any contributions you personally make towards open source should be released to the public as early and as often as you can afford. (Don't hoard your code!) To prove that point, the textbook offers none other than *itself* as a primary example, because this textbook is, in fact, an open source project, and one that is constantly evolving.

In fact, as of writing, the version of the textbook we are reading from, edition 0.8, is [ten years outdated](https://www.theopensourceway.org/wiki/Main_Page) and its original respository depreciated, with the current version maintained in a [different repository](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook). Furthermore, our version seems to be experiencing some amount of [link rot from its own resources](https://www.theopensourceway.org/w/index.php?title=Textbook_Roadmap).

So yes. Release often. But also remember that older releases may still be in use somewhere.
