#### Fixed-price contracts, where the contractor bids a fixed price to complete a system development, may be used to move project risk from client to contractor. If anything goes wrong, the contractor has to pay. Suggest how the use of such contracts may increase the likelihood that product risks will arise.

With fixed-price contracts, the contractor must keeps its budget underneath the negotiated price (with room for profit) for the project to be successful. This effectively creates a ceiling that cannot be crossed outside of catastrophic risks. If mismanaged, this can lead to understaffing, cutting corners, and significant time and budget constraints for the project team, all of which are serious risk factors.

An anecdotal example of this is a government organization awarding a contract to the "lowest bidder" of a project. The bureaucratic nature of Governemnt organizations leads them to prefer low-cost projects to stay within their own budget. However, several such projects have had issues and failed, resulting in massive losses in taxpayer dollars, or in some cases, livelihoods, such as [what happened to Puerto Rico](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/us/fema-contract-puerto-rico.html) after Hurricane Maria.
