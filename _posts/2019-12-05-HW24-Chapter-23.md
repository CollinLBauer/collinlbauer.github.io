## Exercises

### 23.6
#### Figure 23.14 shows the task duration for software project activities. Assume that a serious, unanticipated setback occurs, and instead of taking 10 days, task T5 takes 40 days. Draw up new bar charts showing how the project might be reorganized.

As far as I can tell, T10 is the only task directly dependent on T5, which is not changed since its only other dependency, T9, already extends beyond 40 days of work. As such, this issue does not cause any setbacks.

Bear in mind that this chart does not take staff into account, and may be different depending on staffing limitations.
