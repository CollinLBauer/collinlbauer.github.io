## Exercises

### 21.4
#### Explain why an object-oriented approach to software development may not be suitable for real-time systems.

Object oriented programming encapsulates aspects of a program within object wrappers, which has benefits of increased privacy between programs and greater control over what a program can and cannot do, as most of the time objects talk to one another through interfaces. However, these interfaces introduce overhead which greatly increases execution time. Real-time systems require quick execution times so that any reliant elements have the data they need when they need it.

For living examples of this issue, take a look at some live video games coded in Java. Minecraft servers are notoriously resource intensive and slow down when under a little pressure, and the live game RuneScape operates on a slow tick-based system so it has more time to think between every user action.
