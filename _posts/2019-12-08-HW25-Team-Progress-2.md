Our team had a lot of ups and downs over the few weeks. On the upside, we got all of our drivers up and running! On the downside, there was a lot of internal debate on how edge cases should be handled by said drivers. Automation is mostly done, with every test being run from a script per the specification, but right now it is merely output to shell and not to an HTML document yet, but this shoudn't be too hard to implement.

The biggest bottleneck for our team was definitely communication. We had trouble meeting at times, which ended led to us doing work separately rather than in person. Despite that, we had everything completed in time, which I am very proud of.
