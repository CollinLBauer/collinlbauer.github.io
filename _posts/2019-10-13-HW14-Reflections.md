### Response

Let me just preface this by saying something: I love breaking things. I play video games, and one of my favorite things to do in said games is to study how the game works and see how far I can stretch what it *can* do into what it *shouldn't* do. For a very recent example, a game came out recently called ***Untitled Goose Game*** which allows the player (an inconspicuous goose) to steal arbitrary objects from innocent people and do whatever you want with them. There's even a well where you can drop items in, wherein the items get effectively teleported to a nearby creek. When the developers programmed this well, they assumed that only certain objects would be able to fit. I, in my infinite gooseliness, decided to try and drag really large objects through the well and they teleported through as expected, but the goose unexpectedly went with them! Interactions like this are why I got so interested in programming, and reading this artice's call to action for software testing shows me that my strange curiosity is not only appreciated, but sorely needed in software engineering.

Software Testing, at least on the surface, is the process of testing software and looking for bugs or errors in code. In a perfect world, software would have no errors at all, but they are unavoidable in practice. The author describes multiple "phases" of thinking in terms of software testing, ranging from *phase 0*: "testing doesn't matter" to *phase 4*: "testing as a state of mind". Thinking back on my own testing habits.

Thinking back on my own testing habits, I have always considered testing code important, at least on larger scales, but typically just test as I develop my programs. This is mostly in-line with phase 1 thinking, making sure my program "works" to the extent that it matters. I had a lot of trouble with this in the past, for example, making a drop-down menu on a website function properly, but did not test on other devices or browsers.

Then again, when looking into other people's software (mostly video games), I often spent time simply finding ways to break functionality. The purpose was never really to inform the programmers of their mistakes, but one could argue that this is an example of a "state of mind" if a very loose one. Regerdless, those tests were very revealing of the programmer's intentions and oversights.

tl;dr This article is very informative on how software testing has evolved over time, and I largely agree with how the other says testers should look at the process. I also understand where my past shortcomings have been in testing and how to improve them.
