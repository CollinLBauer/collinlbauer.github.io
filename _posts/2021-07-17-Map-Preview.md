Blog has been quiet, hasn't it? This is mainly due to the [CE3 Season 2 Map Contest](https://haloce3.com/map-contest/) that I have been working hard at finishing. The original due date was July 15th, though it has been pushed back to the end of the month. Nevertheless, my map is *mostly* finished and I have made an initial submission. Here are some sample screenshots of the finished product, **Blamite Mines**.

> *Blamite Mines is a small covenant-themed map, split down the middle with a blamite quarry on one side and a refinery on the other. Most action takes place around the large pit in the center of the map, while powerups and weapons attract players to the far side. It supports all gamemodes except Race. Team play is possible, but a short flag rush distance makes CTF particularly chaotic.*

For some perspective, this is how the original blockout looks. I kept the layout mostly the same, though tweaked a few elements for gameplay flow and atmosphere purposes.

Expect a video or two in the coming weeks showing gameplay and detailing some of the processes I went through creating the map. Normal blog posts will continue when I get the chance.
